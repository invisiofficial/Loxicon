## 🔑 Key Features 🔑

* ***Effortless Switching.*** Choose from a range of downloaded open-source LLMs and easily switch between them based on your needs.
* ***Visual Block-Based Programming.*** Create complex workflows using algorithmic blocks - chain several models, manage data flow, and add logic operations without coding.
* ***Neural Network Orchestration.*** Mix different models in single workflows with different parameters.
* ***Precise Customization.*** Customize conversation parameters like temperature, max tokens and chat history to tailor the LLM's responses to your specific use case.
* ***Seamless Model Testing.*** Effortlessly test your fine-tuned models with this project to ensure optimal performance for your applications.

## 🪽 Quick start 🪽

1. Download the **[latest release version](https://github.com/invisiofficial/Loxicon/releases)** for your operating system.
2. Download a ```.gguf``` file(s) of the desired language model(s) from web resources such as **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)**.
3. Place the downloaded file(s) into a ```Loxicon_Data/StreamingAssets/Models``` folder in a project directory.
4. Create new or use default contexts for chats.
5. Place the context(s) into a ```Loxicon_Data/StreamingAssets/Contexts``` folder in a project directory.
6. Start the application.
7. Build your first algorithm using blocks from a list.
8. Launch the algorithm.
